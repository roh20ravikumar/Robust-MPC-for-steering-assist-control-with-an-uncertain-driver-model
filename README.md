# Robust-MPC-for-steering-assist-control-with-an-uncertain-driver-model
Updates and results of the Robust MPC for steering assist control with an uncertain driver model project as part of the Robust predictive control course

## My Contributions:
1. Developed a 5-DOF vehicle model integrated with driver in the loop, employing a yaw angle tracking driver.
2. Implemented a simplified version of a constraint-tightening logic for the tube MPC, reducing the overall computation time.
3. Utilized the Autonomous driving toolbox on Matlab to simulate the event using a single static obstacle and predefined lane markers.
